•CO2
cannot be reduced electrochemically in an aqueous solution.

But
CO2 levels can be determined indirectly by dissolving it in an aqueous
electrolyte solution and then monitoring the resulting change in pH

Abstract:

The concentration of O2, CO2 in bloodstream of human beings is considered a vital stat in medical science that needs to be measured constantly for emergency and intensive care patients. This brings forward the need of an accurate and sophisticated instrument to analyse blood gas compositions.

We studied about electrode type analysers that determine pH , partial pressure of CO2 and O2 in blood

> Used for measurement of CO2 
> 
> Consists of:
> 
>  -) Co2 sensitive glass electrode in a surrounding film of bicarbonate solution
> 
>  -) Covered by a thin plastic carbon dioxide permeable membrane
> 
>  -) The membrane is impermeable to water and electrolyte solutes.
